# SQL Server Reporting Services in Docker

creates a fresh install of SSRS in a container - pretty useful for dev / test - not for production use!

https://hub.docker.com/r/randreng/ssrs

<a name=build-this-image></a>

## Build this Image

```
docker build -t ssrs --memory 6g .
```

## Run it

This sample is uses mssql-server-windows-developer as a parent image and accepts all the commands listed there:

https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/windows/mssql-server-windows-developer

In addtion it accepts two more env variables: </br>

- **ssrs_user**: Name of a new admin user that will be created to login to report server
- **ssrs_password**: Sets the password for the admin user

example:

```
docker run -d -p 1433:1433 -p 80:80 -v C:/ssrs/:C:/sqldata/ -e sa_password=<YOUR SA PASSWORD> -e ssrs_user=SSRSAdmin -e ssrs_password=<YOUR SSRSAdmin PASSWORD> ssrs
```

then access SSRS at http://localhost/reports and login using ssrs_user

## Tips

- **-p 80:80** to access report manager in browser
- **--memory 6048mb** to bump RAM

## Disclaimers

SSRS is defintely not supported in containers..
